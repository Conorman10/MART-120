                This video represents the intersection between A.I. and Art. The image in the background is A.I. generated, whereas the final audio-reactive composition, and the music itself, were made entirely by myself. The piece represents how music can make any art piece feel more alive. Music is a subject that has not yet been touched by A.I. in a major way, and I hope that we keep it that way.

                This video has less to do with music, and more to do with human movement. In TouchDesigner, I created a project that is reactive to mouse movement. As the mouse moves around the screen, a vortex of red & blue particles follows it around. Without human interaction, the piece would stay completely still, and the true potential of the piece would not be realized. After completing the piece, I added another beat I made in the background in order to make the experience as enjoyable as possible.
